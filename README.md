Creating a new repository in order to complte task 1

Hello there!

I am the guy in the back of the class who likes to do math for fun. I've solved a puzzle that
only two other people in the world have ever done. Besides that, I've done some other notable stuff
like skydiving, marching in the OSU marching band, and hiking the Timberline trail.
